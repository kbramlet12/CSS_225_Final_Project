# CSS_225_Final_Project
My final project is a short, simple murder mystery game. 
The Code is hosted here on GitHub. I have an original copy on my external hard drive if needed. 
There are no external sources 
English is the language used and you will need to have a computer with enough memory space to download a software that can run python codes. 
I use IDLE (python 3.10 64 bit).
Copy the code from here and paste it into your IDLE file. Save and  run the module. 
Start the game by reading the introduction and entering your character name. 
Follow the prompts to collect clues and discover who the killer is!
I apologize that there are a few choices that make the program crash.
Re open to try again, I promise there is a way to the end!
